## Overview

[Konarr][konarr] is a simple, easy-to-use web interface for monitoring your servers, clusters, and containers supply chain for dependencies and vulnerabilities.
It is designed to be lightweight and fast, with minimal resource usage. 

It is written in [Rust][rust-lang], uses [Rocker][rocket] for the web server, and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the front-end.

<details>
<summary><strong>Origin Story</strong></summary>

This project came out of the need to monitor my homelab for insecure dependencies / components.
All the products that offer this are proprietary and cost money to use.

[In December 2021, Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell) came dropped and like most of the world I was running around trying to find if I had a service using it.
Turned out I was but it was a painful process in finding if I was even using it.

**Name Origin:**

Konarr is from the name [Konar quo Maten](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Konar_quo_Maten) (translated as Konar the Hunter) from the game [Old School Runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/).

## ✨ Features

- Simple, easy-to-use web interface
- Blazing fast performance with minimal resource usage (written in [Rust][rust-lang] 🦀)
- Real-time monitoring of your containers
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for your containers
- Supply chain attack monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start

This small script will install the Konarr server and agent on your machine using containers.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/42ByteLabs/konarr/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash -s
```

## 🛠️ Installation

### Server

The Konarr Server is a Rust (Server) and VueJS (frontend) that 

#### Konarr Server using Docker Compose

```bash
# Clone the Konarr repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/42ByteLabs/konarr.git && cd konarr
# Update submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Spin up container using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

*Note:* Podman-compose also works.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

- `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/42ByteLabs/konarr/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml` - This command downloads the `docker-compose.yml` file from the Konarr repository on GitHub. This file contains the configuration for the Konarr server and the Konarr agent.
- `docker-compose up -d` - This command tells Docker Compose to start the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The `-d` flag tells Docker Compose to run the containers in the background.

</details>

#### Konarr Server using Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -v ./data:/data \
    -v ./config:/config \
    ghcr.io/42bytelabs/konarr:v0.1.0
```

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

This command does the following:

- `-it --rm` - This is a common set of flags to pass to `docker run`. The `-it` flag is short for `--interactive` and `--tty`, which tells Docker to open an interactive terminal inside the container. The `--rm` flag tells Docker to automatically remove the container when it stops running.
- `-p 9000:9000` - This tells Docker to map port 9000 on the host machine to port 9000 on the container. This is the port that the Konarr server listens on by default.
- `-v ./data:/data` - This tells Docker to mount the `./data` directory on the host machine to the `/data` directory on the container. This is where Konarr stores its data by default.
- `-v ./config:/config` - This tells Docker to mount the `./config` directory on the host machine to the `/config` directory on the container. This is where Konarr looks for its configuration file by default.
- `ghcr.io/42bytelabs/konarr:v0.1.0` - This is the name of the Docker image that we want to run. The `ghcr.io/42bytelabs/konarr` part is the name of the repository on GitHub Container Registry, and the `v0.1.0` part is the tag of the image that we want to run.

</details>

### Agent

The Konarr Agent is the Konarr CLI that is used to monitor your containers.
It is written in Rust and is available as a binary or as a Docker image.

#### Running Agent in Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -e KONARR_INSTANCE \
    -e KONARR_AGENT_TOKEN \
    -e KONARR_PROJECT_ID \
    ghcr.io/42bytelabs/konarr-agent:v0.1.0
```

#### Install via Cargo

The konarr-cli is a Rust binary that can be installed via Cargo.

```bash
cargo install konarr-cli
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the Konarr repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/42ByteLabs/konarr.git && cd konarr
# Update submodules (client/frontend is a submodule)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build frontend
cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
# Build and run server
cargo run -p konarr-server --release -- -c ./konarr.yml
```
